### Break Out
<p>This was my attempt at a famous arcade game by the name of breakout. I used SFML and tried to make the code coherent but I failed.
At least I learned something. I'll leave this here as a marker of my attempt.
Just install SFML as usual, nothing else then compile it as normal and you should be set. If you can't do that,
please visit my repository and look for my cmake generating python script. It will do it for you, assuming you downloaded
the SFML library.</p>
