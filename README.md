# Breakout

This was my attempt at a famous arcade game by the name of breakout. I used SFML and tried to make the code coherent but I failed.
At least I learned something. I'll leave this here as a marker of my attempt.

## Installation

1. **Install SFML:** Follow the instructions on the SFML website (https://www.sfml-dev.org/) to install the necessary libraries for your system.

2. **Clone the Repository:** Download or clone this repository to your local machine.

3. **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt in the project directory and compile the code using the following command:

   ```bash
   g++ breakout.cpp -o breakout -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-audio -lsfml-system -lsfml-network
